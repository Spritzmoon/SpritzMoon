The SpritzMoon Crypto Token (spritzmoon), totally made in Italy, is a Crypto DeFi developed on Binance BlockChain (BSC).

 

During each exchange, 2 simple functions are realized:

 

1) Recogniton of a fixed income (Reflection) 2%

 

2) Liquidity Provider, LP Acquisition 2%

 

It's inizially quoted on PancakeSwap as the token  is based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Now SpritzMoon is quoted on Exchange and we esc from Pancake because is not secure for our Holders, so the LP acquisition is not operative on Exchange.

 

The concept of Community Driven, project entrusted to the community, is aim to bring to the Crypto (SPRITZMOON) all lovers of the famous aperitif with lifestyle "Spritz" encouraging the possession and maintenance in time of the token, so more people will enter the community the more the price will grow (Reflection) and more tokens will be burned (Burn). All by discouraging sales and HODL it.

 

The protocol is designed with a fee of 2% on sales, which is distributed for 2% to the current holders. In practice, the system rewards token holders.


This is the strategy to get safely to bring the Spritz to the Moon, which inspired the name SpritzMoon.


SpritzMoon's goal is triple, simple and within reach of all:


1) Bring everyone closer to the Crypto world with ease, distributing wealth within the Community itself


2) Sociality, specifically helping the various associations related to the Spritz theme, to prevent any kind of excess


3) Allow all community members to use the token as a "Utility Token" for Weekend Spritz with Friends

 

 

 

The Road Map will last four years (2021-2025), will provide direct contributions for charitable projects towards all Associations sensitive to the theme "Drink moderately" or "Guide responsibly" or "Enjoy yourself, but Don't Sprizt Too Much", the realization of a Wallet Card, an Online Shop for the community, a Foundation totally dedicated to the social aspect of the SpritzMoon project as well as an Exchange of NFTs as the ultimate goal.


The strong point of the project will be the "SpritzMoon Community" with development activities on various social media such as Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, Medium, Linkedin. ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
